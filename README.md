Hide Plugin & Mimetype Identifiers, for Firefox
========================

[Install here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/happy-bonobo-plugins-mimety/)

Prevent sites from grabbing a list of your plugins & mime types. Such lists can be used to uniquely identify you.

I also recommend installing FlashBlock, since it prevents your fonts from being harvested.

Please note: If you've made any custom changes to the `plugins.enumerable_names` setting in `about:config`, this plugin will reset them.

Feel free to make a GitHub issue, or pull request. Thanks.

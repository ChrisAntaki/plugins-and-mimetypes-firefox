Cloak Plugins & Mimetypes, for Firefox
========================

Hide in the forest, with a clean removal of your plugin & mimetype identifiers.

I also recommend installing FlashBlock, since it prevents your fonts from being harvested.

### Whitelisted Applications:
- Google Gmail
- Google Hangouts

Feel free to suggest more. Just make a GitHub issue, or pull request. Thanks.
